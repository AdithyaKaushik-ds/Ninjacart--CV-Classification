# Ninjacart-CV-Classification

**Overview**

Ninjacart is India's largest fresh produce supply chain company, leveraging technology to solve one of the toughest supply chain challengesâ€”delivering fresh products from farmers to businesses within 12 hours. This case study focuses on developing a robust image classification model to distinguish between different types of vegetables and filter out noisy (irrelevant) images.

**Dataset
**
- The dataset consists of 3,135 images categorized into four folders, representing different vegetable types and noise.
- Each image is preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.

**Problem Statement**

The objective is to build a deep learning-based classifier that accurately classifies vegetable images while distinguishing irrelevant images (noise) to ensure correct product delivery in Ninjacart's supply chain.

**Approach**

**Data Preprocessing:**

- Images were resized to a fixed dimension.
- Normalization was applied to scale pixel values.
- Augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments were used.

**Model Selection & Training:** 

- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification.
- Transfer learning approaches using ResNet and EfficientNet were explored.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

**Performance Evaluation:**

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score were used as evaluation metrics.
- A confusion matrix revealed misclassifications, particularly among visually similar vegetables.

**Results**

- The CNN model achieved good classification accuracy with some misclassifications.
- Transfer learning models like ResNet and EfficientNet improved overall accuracy.
- The model had difficulty distinguishing between certain vegetable categories and noisy images in some cases.

**Recommendations**

- Enhance data augmentation with additional techniques such as zoom, contrast adjustments, and elastic transformations.
- Address class imbalance using SMOTE or class-weighted loss functions.
- Experiment with deeper CNN architectures and hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Bayesian Optimization).
- Deploy the model in a real-world environment using TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for efficient inference.
